# User Behavior Analysis and Prediction in Email Campaigns

This project aims to extract data-driven insights from an e-commerce market email campaign, which identifies principal components affecting email open rates using chi-square and F-tests and forecasts user engagement using a machine learning model.

This notebook was inpsired by [Stasi's Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/stasi009/TakeHomeDataChallenges/tree/master/07.MarketingEmail), and has been modified and enhanced to address an existing bug. The issue arises because the two groups—users who clicked links and those who opened links—may not always form simple subsets as previously assumed. Therefore, additional data cleaning steps have been added.
